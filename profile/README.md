At Dexmach we have the purpose to evangelize our vision and cloud strategy to organizations. 
We have a **deep passion** for **Microsoft cloud technologies** with an **atypical mindset**.


We believe in our clients and our [Dexmach #oneteam](https://www.dexmach.com) approach. 
Collaborating and guiding our customers is and should be fun ðŸ˜¸.
